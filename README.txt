PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE USING THE LIBRARY :

- Concerning the camera data file, just change the data as you wish, but nothing else !
It would cause the program to give wrong results

- You will need the JAVACV library to run the undistortion algorithm. 
Just download it there https://github.com/bytedeco/javacv and add it to your project libraries.

- To use the library, just add it to your Java project, and create an Undistortion Object to run it
